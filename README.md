[See the project live](http://redirectioneaza.ro/)

HELPING SHOULD BE SIMPLE - Every year people can redirect 2% of their income tax to a worthy cause. However, most of them never do it, being put off by two hurdles: the bureaucratic process and the lack of information on NGOs they could help.

Moreover, NGOs themselves have a hard time getting their message across to as many people as possible.

The website will have information on a variety of NGOs that can be supported by redirecting 2% of the income tax. It will also be a means for NGOs to showcase their projects to a wider audience and convince them to re-direct the 2% to them.

Direct contact between the two will not be necessary anymore, which means saving time and resources for both and more #230 tax forms submitted.

SUPPORT A WORTHY CAUSE FOR FREE IN 5 EASY STEPS

1. browse and choose the NGO you want to redirect 2% of your income tax to
2. fill in tax form #230 online
3. print the filled in form
4. sign the form
5. mail the form to your ANAF agency

## Contributing

This project is built by amazing volunteers and you can be one of them! Here's a list of ways in [which you can contribute to this project](.github/CONTRIBUTING.MD).

## Built With

Flask 1.0.2 / Python 3.7

### Package managers

Bower

### Database technology & provider

PostgreSQL / SQLAlchemy

## App structure

The entry point of the app is `run.py`. 
All the routes are defined in `redirectioneaza\routes.py`.

The application itself is located in the folder `redirectioneaza`.


Its main components are
* `controllers`  this module contains the views for each route
* `handlers` this module contains the following helpers:
    * `pdf` the logic for creating the pdf
    * `email` a small wrapper over SendGrid
    * `base` contains the base view handler from which all views should inherit
    * `captcha` the logic behind captcha validation on pages with forms
    * `utils` utilities  
* `static` all the static files: css, js, images
* `templates` all the html files + email templates. New html pages should extend `base.html`
* `config.py` configuration data
* `core.py` defines the core objects such as app, db and login_manager
* `routes.py` defines all the routes used by the app

### Bulding new handlers

New handlers should extend `BaseHandler` from `handlers.base`. 

The path to the html file should be set as `template_name`. The app looks in the `views` folder for it.
To send props to the view, use the dict `self.template_values`.

## Deployment

1. Clone the repo into a folder: `git clone https://github.com/code4romania/redirectioneaza`
2. Set up a virtual env `virtualenv venv` and activate it `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the requirements : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install front-end development assets `bower install`
5. Initialize the database and populate with dummy data:

`python manage.py initdb` then
`python manage.py load_dummy`

6.  To run the application, run:
`python run.py`

The app will be ran by default on `localhost:5000`.

### CSS
The app uses `LESS`. To compile the CSS, run:
```sh
cd ./static/
lessc css/main.less > css/main.css --clean-css="--s1 --advanced --compatibility=ie8"
```

### Migrations

For database migrations, use the commands for [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
`python manage.py migrations` - will display a list of available commands, whereas for example `python manage.py migrations init` would set up the initial migration.

### Tests

To run tests:
1. `cd tests`
2. `pytest`

This will run both unit and selenium/integration testing. To run a particular set of tests or a particular tests run `pytest test_app` and e.g. `pytest test_app.py::test_name` respectively.
